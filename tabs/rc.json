The E, A and B/A chords start on beat 1 of each bar while the 7th chords start on the\n\"and\" of beat 2. On the record the song fades out over the last line of the final chorus. You could just\nrepeat the last line a few times before stopping.\nA later version of the song was released by Sam Cooke under the name \"Please Don't Drive Me Away\".\n\n[Chords]\n[ch]E[/ch]    : 022100\n[ch]E7[/ch]   : 022130\n[ch]A[/ch]    : x02225\n[ch]A7[/ch]   : x02223\n[ch]B/A[/ch]  : x04447\n[ch]B7/A[/ch] : x04445\n\n[Intro]\n[ch]E[/ch]       [ch]E7[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]E7[/ch]\n[ch]E[/ch]       [ch]E7[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]E7[/ch]\n[ch]A[/ch]       [ch]A7[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]A7[/ch]\n[ch]E[/ch]       [ch]E7[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]E7[/ch]\n[ch]B/A[/ch]     [ch]B7/A[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]A7[/ch]\n[ch]E[/ch]       [ch]E7[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]E7[/ch]\n\n[Verse 1]\n[ch]E[/ch]           [ch]E7[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]     [ch]E7[/ch]\n I love you baby, I want you by my side\n[ch]E[/ch]            [ch]E7[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]     [ch]E7[/ch]\n My love for you, I could never hide\n\n[Chorus]\n[ch]A[/ch]       [ch]A7[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]A7[/ch]\n If you love me, hear my plea\n[ch]E[/ch]             [ch]E7[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]E7[/ch]\n Don't put me out, in the street\n       [ch]B/A[/ch]   [ch]B7/A[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]A7[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]     [ch]E7[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]E7[/ch]\nI said ple - ase,      don't drive me a-way\n       [ch]B/A[/ch]   [ch]B7/A[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]A7[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]     [ch]E7[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]E7[/ch]\nI said ple - ase,      don't drive me a-way\n\n[Verse 2]\n[ch]E[/ch]           [ch]E7[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]E7[/ch]\n I love you baby, won't do you no wrong\n[ch]E[/ch]        [ch]E7[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]        [ch]E7[/ch]\n Come on back here, let's go home\n\n[Chorus]\n[ch]A[/ch]       [ch]A7[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]A7[/ch]\n If you love me, hear my plea\n[ch]E[/ch]             [ch]E7[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]E7[/ch]\n Don't put me out, in the street\n       [ch]B/A[/ch]   [ch]B7/A[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]A7[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]     [ch]E7[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]E7[/ch]\nI said ple - ase,      don't drive me a-way\n       [ch]B/A[/ch]   [ch]B7/A[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]A7[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]     [ch]E7[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]E7[/ch]\nI said ple - ase,      don't drive me a-way\n\n[Verse 3]\n[ch]E[/ch]           [ch]E7[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]E7[/ch]\n I love you baby, you don't even care\n[ch]E[/ch]          [ch]E7[/ch]        [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]E7[/ch]\n Come back here, and answer my prayer\n\n[Chorus]\n[ch]A[/ch]       [ch]A7[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]A7[/ch]\n If you love me, hear my plea\n[ch]E[/ch]             [ch]E7[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]E7[/ch]\n Don't put me out, in the street\n       [ch]B/A[/ch]   [ch]B7/A[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]A7[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]     [ch]E7[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]E7[/ch]\nI said ple - ase,      don't drive me a-way\n       [ch]B/A[/ch]   [ch]B7/A[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]A7[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]     [ch]E7[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]E7[/ch]\nI said ple - ase,      don't drive me a-way"}},{"artist":"R.
