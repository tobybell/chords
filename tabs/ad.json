on Jools Holland 'Later' November 2010\nprior to its release on the '21' album in 2011.\nThat Jools performance was accompanied by piano, but an arpeggiated acoustic\nguitar works beautifully with the song too.\n\nThis song is best picked rather than strummed, just playing simple patterns on the basic \nchords. I have added suggestions for the picking pattern at the bottom of the tab.\n***\n(Original guitar chord names listed in this version were completely off. I used find and paste technique from \nMSWord to make fixes to reflect finger positions. I am not sure of how to affect changes to the pop up \nchording that is for uke and I did not address the uke chord variations at document end but I hope this helps \nsoothe some tensions for those that want to play this version of the song with properly named guitar chords \nfor the listed finger positions. \nStephen Honkanen. shonkanen@yahoo.com 1/4/15)\n***\nTuning:
