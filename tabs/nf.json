just for you then you're so wrong\r\n                     [ch]G[/ch]\r\nAs I kid I built a house around my broke heart\r\n\r\nSometimes you don't know what you had until it falls apart, 'til it falls

Are you confused?\n\nCome upstairs and I'll show you what I mean\n              [ch]Am[/ch]\nThis room's full of regrets, just keeps getting fuller it seems\n               [ch]F[/ch]\nThe moment I walk in to it is the same moment that I wanna leave\n [ch]Dm[/ch]\nI get sick to my stomach every time I look at these things\n     [ch]F[/ch]                                           [ch]F#m[/ch]\nBut it's hard to look past when this is the room where I sleep\n[ch]Dm[/ch]\nI look around. One of the worst things I wrote on these walls\n [ch]F[/ch]\nWas the moment I realized that I was losing my mom\n                [ch]Dm[/ch]                       [ch]F[/ch]\nAnd one of the first things I wrote was I was shot with a call\n                             [ch]G[/ch]\nBut I should just stop now, we ain't got enough room in this song\n             [ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]F[/ch]\nAnd I regret the fact that I struggled trying to find who I am\n\nAnd I lie to myself and say I do the best that I can\n\nShrug it off like it ain't nothing like it's out of my hands\n                                    [ch]G[/ch]\nThen get ticked off whenever I see it affecting my plans\n              [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]\nAnd I regret watching these trust issues eat me alive\n\nAnd at the rate I'm going they'll probably still be there when I die\n[ch]Dm[/ch]\nCongratulations, you'll always have a room in my mind\n [ch]F[/ch]                                      [ch]G[/ch]\nThe question is: Will I ever clean the walls off in time?\n\n(repeat chorus)\n\n\n[Verse 3 - NF:]\n [ch]Am[/ch]                       [ch]F#m[/ch]\nSo this part of my house, no one's been in it for years\n [ch]F[/ch]\nI built the safe room and I don't let no one in there\n       [ch]Dm[/ch]\nCause if I do, there's a chance\n                                [ch]F[/ch]\nThat they might disappear and not come back\n                      [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]\nAnd I admit I am emotionally scared to let anyone inside\n\nSo I just leave my doors locked\n           [ch]F[/ch]\nYou might get other doors to open up but this doors not\n                     [ch]Dm[/ch]\nCause I don't want you to have the opportunity to hurt me\n              [ch]F[/ch]                                       [ch]G[/ch]\nAnd I'll be the only person that I can blame when you desert me\n\nI'm barricaded inside\n    [ch]Am[/ch]\nSo stop watching\n [ch]F[/ch]\nI'm not coming to the door\n    \nSo stop knocking, stop knocking\n[ch]Am[/ch]\nI'm trapped here\n                      [ch]F[/ch]\nGod keep saying I'm not locked in\n\nI chose this\n [ch]G[/ch]\nI am lost in my own conscious\n                  [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]\nI know that shutting the wall down ain't solving the problem\n\nBut I didn't build this house because I thought it would solve 'em\n[ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]\nI built it because I thought that it would be safer in there\n                   [ch]G[/ch]\nBut it's not, I'm not the only thing that's living in here\n[ch]Am[/ch]\nFear came to my house years ago I let 'em in\n[ch]F[/ch]\nMaybe that's the problem\n\nCause I've been dealing with this ever since\n                [ch]Dm[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch] \nI thought that he would leave, but it's obvious he never did\n                                     [ch]G[/ch]\nHe must have picked the room and got comfortable and settled in\n               [ch]Am[/ch]\nNow I'm in the position it's either sit here and let him win\n    [ch]F[/ch]                                           [ch]C[/ch]\nOr put him back outside where he came from, but I never can\n[ch]Dm[/ch]\nCause in order to do that I'd have to open the doors\n[ch]F[/ch]\nIs that me or the fear talking?\n\nI don't know anymore\n\nInstrumental: [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]Dm[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]    [ch]Dm[/ch]   \n[ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]\nIt's lonely\n  [ch]Dm[/ch]\nInside this
