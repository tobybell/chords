There are other ways to play F#madd4\nbut I think this is the easiest, which is probably why Frey chose to use it.\n\nThey definitely play this in the key of E, but on the studio recording from \nTheir Greatest Hits (1971-1975) they aren't tuned to concert standard\n(A=440hz), or to anything else that makes sense, like a half-step flat.  I\nfind that if I set my tuner to A=433hz it comes out just right.  The same is\ntrue of Take It Easy, so my best guess is that whatever they tuned to in\nthe studio was off a bit.  Play this along with the studio recording and\nyou'll see what I mean.\n\nThis is a modification of another entry I found here, but I can't remember\nwhose it was.  Constructive criticism is most welcome.
