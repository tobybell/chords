Horses\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTabbed by: jvwald\n\nThis tab is based on this YouTube video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KL4bBiDCI0\n\nI’ll start by saying that I don’t know why Ben plays it this way. It's\nclear when you watch him play it live like in the video above that he's\nnot in standard tuning. And if someone uses such a non-standard tuning,\nyou would assume that it's because it makes the song sound so much different\nor better than standard tuning. I think this song sounds just as good in\nstandard tuning like it is shown in other tabs on this site. One guess is\nthat Ben is a self described \"terrible guitar player\" and maybe this tuning\nmakes it easier to play and easier for him to locate where he is on the\nfretboard.\n\nI realize the last thing this site needs is another version of this song.\nI guess I just thought it would be interesting to figure out and post this\ntab the way he plays it, even though I would probably never go through the\ntrouble to retune this to play it \"correctly.\" If anyone has any suggestions\nfor changes to this tab or if you have thoughts about why this odd tuning,\nI’d be happy to hear them. If you do have suggestions, please refer to\nvideos of the band playing live.\n\nCapo: III\n\nTuning: FFD#G#A#E (he doesn't appear to play either the high or low E string\nbut you can tune the low E up to F if you want for a fuller sound on the\nFII chord)\n\nF xx(14)(13)(14)x\n[ch]C[/ch] xx989x\n[ch]G[/ch] xx434x\n[ch]Am[/ch] xx646x\n[ch]G[/ch]II x2434x\n[ch]C[/ch]II x7989x\n[ch]F[/ch]II x0212x\n\nintro\ne|-------------------------------------------------|\nB|--------14---------9--------4-------6-------6----|\nG|-----13----13\\---8---8\\---3---3---4---4---4---4--|\nD|--14-----------9--------4-------6-------6--------|\nA|-------------------------------------------------|\nE|-------------------------------------------------|\n\nintro x6\nI'm coming up only to hold you under\nAnd coming up only to show you're wrong\nAnd to know you is hard; we wonder...\nTo know you all wrong; we warn.\nOoooooooh Oooooooooh\nOoooooooh Oooooooooh\n\n[ch]F[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]\nReally too late to call, so we wait for\n[ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]\nMorning to wake you is all we got\n[ch]F[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]\nto know me as hardly golden\n[ch]F[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]          riff 1\nIs to know me all wrong, they warn.\n\nriff 1\ne|-------------------|\nB|------6-------6----|\nG|----4---4---4---4--|\nD|--6-------6--------|\nA|-------------------|\nE|-------------------|\n\n[ch]G[/ch]II                        [ch]C[/ch]II           [ch]F[/ch]II\nAt every occasion I'll be ready for the funeral\n[ch]G[/ch]II                      [ch]C[/ch]II                   [ch]F[/ch]II\nAt every occasion, once more, it's called the funeral\n[ch]G[/ch]II                         [ch]C[/ch]II           [ch]F[/ch]II\nAt every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral\n[ch]G[/ch]II                      [ch]C[/ch]II         [ch]F[/ch]II\nEvery occasion, oh, one billion day funeral\n\nintro x2\nI'm coming up only to show you're down for\nAnd coming up only to show you're wrong.\n\n[ch]F[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]\nTo the outside, the dead leaves lay on the lawn\n[ch]F[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]\nFor they don't have trees to hang upon.\n[ch]F[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Am[/ch]\nOoooooooh Oooooooooh\n[ch]F[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]    riff 1\nOoooooooh Oooooooooh\n\n[ch]G[/ch]II                        [ch]C[/ch]II           [ch]F[/ch]II\nAt every occasion I'll be ready for the funeral\n[ch]G[/ch]II                      [ch]C[/ch]II                   [ch]F[/ch]II\nAt every occasion, once more, it's called the funeral\n[ch]G[/ch]II                         [ch]C[/ch]II           [ch]F[/ch]II\nAt every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral\n[ch]G[/ch]II                      [ch]C[/ch]II         [ch]F[/ch]II\nEvery occasion, oh, one billion day funeral\n\n\n************************************\n\n| /   slide up\n| \\   slide down\n| h   hammer-on\n| p   pull-off\n| ~   vibrato\n| +   harmonic\n| x   Mute note\n| b   Bend\n| pb  Pre-bend\n| br  Bend release\n| pbr Pre-bend release\n| brb Bend release bend\n\n************************************"}}]
